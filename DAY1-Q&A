1.EXPLAIN FUNCTION OF JK & SR FLIP FLOP
JK FLIP FLOP IS A SEQUENTIAL LOGIC CIRCUIT THAT STORE BINARY INFORMATION IN BITWISE MANNER. 
IT CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INPUTS:
J(SET)
K(RESET)
CLOCK(CLK)
PRESET(PR) AND CLEAR(CLEAR)
OUPUTS:
Q
Q'
Truth Table for a JK Flip-Flop:
J	K	CLK	Q (next state)	Q' (next state)
0	0	↑	Q (no change)	Q' (no change)
0	1	↑	0	            1
1	0	↑	1	            0
1	1	↑	Toggles 	Toggles 

SR FLIP FLOP A SEQUENTIAL LOGIC CIRCUIT THAT SET OR RESET OUTPUT(Q) TO 1 OR 0;
INPUTS:
S(SET)
R(RESET)
CLOCK(CLK)
PRESET(PR) AND CLEAR(CLEAR)
OUPUTS:
Q
Q'
Truth Table for an SR Flip-Flop:
S	R	Q (next state)	Q' (next state)	
0	0	Q (no change)	Q' (no change)
0	1	0	            1	(Reset Q = 0, Q' = 1)
1	0	1	            0	(Set Q = 1, Q' = 0)
1	1	Invalid		    Invalid state (not allowed)

2. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLIPFLOP AND LATCH
LATCH IS A LEVEL SENSITIVE DEVICE THAT CONTINUOUSLY CHECK INPUT AND CHANGE ITS OUPUTS AS LONG AS THERE'S A ENABLE SIGNAL
FLIFLOP IS A EDGE-TRIGGERED DEVICE - IT CHANGES IT OUTPUT ONLY ON RISING OR FALLING EDGE

3. WHY ARE LATCH FASTER THAN FLIPFLOP
FLIPFLOP HAS TO WAIT FOR THE CLOCK SIGNAL, WHILE LATCH DOESN'T.

4. EXPLAIN THE USE OF FLIPFLOP AND LATCH.
LATCH IS USE IN APPLICATION WHERE TRANSPARENCY(CONTINOUS MONITORING) IS REQUIRED
FLIFLOP IS USE IN SYNCHRONIZTION APPLICATION.

5. WHY IS THE GATED SR FLIPFLOP CALLED ASYNCHRONOUS LATCH
A GATED SR FLIPFLOP HAS A ENABLE INPUT THAT CONTROLS WHEN S AND R INPUT CAN INFLUENCE THE STATE OF THE FLIPFLOP, WHICH MEANS 
IT'S NOT STRICTLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH A CLOCK SIGNAL. INSTEAD IT RELIES ON A INPUT(ENABLE)
