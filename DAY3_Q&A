2. Explain difference between:
Encoder: Converts input data into a different representation, often more compact or structured.
Decoder: Reconstruct the encoded data back to its orginary form
Priority encoder: Similar to encoder but it handle multiple input by assign priority to highest-order input.

3. Explain application of:
priority encoder: Interruption handling in microprocessor(multiple input deivce: keyboard,mouse...)
priority Decoder: Memory Address decoding(ensure highest-priority memory is accessed first.)

4. Explain function:
digital encoder: Converts multiple input signals into a coded binary output
digital decoder: deconstruct a binary coded input into a set of output signals.
